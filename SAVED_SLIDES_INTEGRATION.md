# Saved Slides Integration Documentation

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation of the AI slide generator integration with the layout/theme system and the saved slides functionality.

## Features Implemented

### 1. AI Slide Generator with Layout/Theme Integration

- **Component**: `StreamingSlideGeneratorV2.tsx`
- **Service**: `slideLayoutAssignment.ts`
- Generates slides using AI and automatically assigns appropriate layouts and themes
- Layout assignment based on slide type and content structure
- Theme selection based on presentation topic and style preferences

### 2. Enhanced Data Structure

- **Type**: `GeneratedSlide` in `slide.type.ts`
- Added layout, theme, and structured content mapping to slide data
- Supports rich content types: text, bullet points, images, charts, code blocks

### 3. Save Generated Slides

- **Feature**: Save modal in `StreamingSlideGeneratorV2.tsx`
- Users can save generated slide presentations to their profile
- Includes presentation metadata: title, description, creation date, slide count
- Saves complete layout and theme information with slides

### 4. Saved Slides Management

- **Service**: `savedSlidesService.ts`
- **Component**: `SavedSlidesManager.tsx`
- **Page**: `SavedSlidesPage.tsx`
- Local storage-based CRUD operations for saved presentations
- Search and filter functionality
- Preview, export, and delete options
- Responsive grid layout for presentation cards

### 5. Navigation Integration

- **Component**: `Header.tsx`
- Added "Saved Slides" navigation link in the main header
- Only visible to authenticated users
- Uses BookOutlined icon for visual consistency

### 6. User Profile Integration

- **Component**: `UserProfile.tsx`
- Enhanced "My Projects" section to display both video projects and slide presentations
- Shows slide presentations as "Processing Slides Without Audio"
- Separate sections for Video Projects and Slide Presentations
- Updated statistics to include presentation counts
- Added quick action buttons for slide-related features
- Preview and edit functionality for saved presentations

## Technical Implementation

### Layout Assignment Logic

The `SlideLayoutAssignmentService` assigns layouts based on:

- **Title slides**: Use title-focused layouts with hero sections
- **Content slides**: Use content-heavy layouts with proper text distribution
- **List slides**: Use bullet-point optimized layouts
- **Media slides**: Use image/chart-friendly layouts
- **Conclusion slides**: Use summary-focused layouts

### Theme Selection

Themes are assigned based on:

- **Topic**: Business, education, technology, etc.
- **Tone**: Professional, creative, academic, etc.
- **Color preferences**: Corporate blues, creative gradients, academic neutrals

### Data Storage

- Uses browser localStorage for persistence
- Structured JSON format for easy retrieval and manipulation
- Includes metadata for search and filtering capabilities

2. Browse saved presentations in a grid layout
3. Use search to find specific presentations
4. Preview presentations with layout/theme intact
5. Export presentations for external use
6. Delete presentations no longer needed

## Future Enhancements

- Backend integration for cloud storage
- Sharing and collaboration features
- Advanced layout customization
- Presentation templates and themes gallery
- Export to PowerPoint/PDF formats
- Version history and slide revision tracking

## Development Notes

- All components use TypeScript for type safety
- Ant Design components for consistent UI/UX
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop
- Error handling and loading states implemented
- ESLint configuration for code quality

## Testing

To test the complete flow:

1. Start the development server: `pnpm dev`
2. Navigate to http://localhost:5174
3. Use the AI Slide Generator to create presentations
4. Save presentations and verify they appear in Saved Slides
5. Test search, preview, and delete functionality
